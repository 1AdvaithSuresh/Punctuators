README
Goal: Train sequence-to-sequence and sequence-labelling models to punctuate unpunctuated Indonesian text. 

This repository contains code to train, decode and evaluate a seq2seq transformer punctuator model (in ./seq2seq) 
and a seqlab CRF punctuator model (in ./seqlab). 

This sample does not contain code for the actual neural networks themselves. But does contain training notebooks.
